# Tab-Automation
If you have a finite set of tabs that you constantly use, this could be very helpful on a day-to-day basis.
I personally designed this because there are about 6 tabs I need at all times, everything after that is extra.
Furthermore, I have multiple sets of credentials for different parts of the same site and it's easy to get lost.

This eliminates those problems and, more importantly, has room for flexibility. If you work in a project-based environment and
have someone who allocates your assignments, you can simply adjust the script to pull its csv data from a shared online source (Google Sheets etc.).
Then, they can add it to your tab list with the credentials you need and, the next time you run the application, you
will get the updated views indicating where you need to be and the credentials you'll need for each respective site.

## To use:

1. Download
4. Save somewhere easily-accessible (i.e Desktop) 
5. Fill in your tab data
6. Click on the Work_URLs Application!
